Use of sympathomimetics and compounds such as guanethidine, methyldopa, methylphenidate, reserpine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylalanine, dopamine, levodopa, tyrosine, and tryptophan with Marplan may precipitate hypertension, headache, and related symptoms. The combination of MAO inhibitors and tryptophan has been reported to cause behavioral and neurologic symptoms, including disorientation, confusion, amnesia, delirium, agitation, hypomanic signs, ataxia, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, shivering, ocular oscillations, and Babinski signs.\\r\\nMeperidine should not be used concomitantly with MAO inhibitors or within 2 or 3 weeks following MAO therapy. Serious reactions have been precipitated with concomitant use, including coma, severe hypertension or hypotension, severe respiratory depression, convulsions, malignant hyperpyrexia, excitation, peripheral vascular collapse, and death. It is thought that these reactions may be mediated by accumulation of 5-HT (serotonin) consequent to MAO inhibition.\\r\\nMarplan should not be used in combination with dextromethorphan. The combination of MAO inhibitors and dextromethorphan has been reported to cause brief episodes of psychosis or bizarre behavior.\\r\\nHypertensive crises have sometimes occurred during Marplan therapy after ingestion of foods with a high tyramine content. In general, patients should avoid protein foods in which aging or protein breakdown is used to increase flavor. In particular, patients should be instructed not to take foods such as cheese (particularly strong or aged varieties), sour cream, Chianti wine, sherry, beer (including non-alcoholic beer), liqueurs, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, liver, canned figs, raisins, bananas or avocados (particularly if overripe), chocolate, soy sauce, sauerkraut, the pods of broad beans (fava beans), yeast extracts, yogurt, meat extracts, meat prepared with tenderizers, or dry sausage.\\r\\nPatients taking Marplan should not undergo elective surgery requiring general anesthesia. Also, they should not be given cocaine or local anesthesia containing sympathomimetic vasoconstrictors. The possible combined hypotensive effects of Marplan and spinal anesthesia should be kept in mind. Marplan should be discontinued at least 10 days before elective surgery.\\r\\nMarplan should not be used in combination with some central nervous system depressants, such as narcotics, barbiturates, or alcohol. \\r\\nMarplan should not be used in combination with antihypertensive agents, including thiazide diuretics. A marked potentiating effect on these drugs has been reported, resulting in hypotension.\\r\\nExcessive use of caffeine in any form should be avoided in patients receiving Marplan.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CUPRIMINE is indicated in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and in patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Available evidence suggests that CUPRIMINE is not of value in ankylosing spondylitis. \\r\\nWilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) occurs in individuals who have inherited an autosomal-recessive defect that leads to an accumulation of copper far in excess of metabolic requirements. The excess copper is deposited in several organs and tissues, and eventually produces pathological effects primarily in the liver, where damage progresses to postnecrotic cirrhosis, and in the brain, where degeneration is widespread. Copper is also deposited as characteristic, asymptomatic, golden-brown Kayser-Fleischer rings in the corneas of all patients with cerebral symptomatology and some patients who are either asymptomatic or manifest only hepatic symptomatology. \\r\\nTwo types of patients require treatment for Wilson's disease: (1) the symptomatic, and (2) the asymptomatic in whom it can be assumed the disease will develop in the future if the patient is not treated. \\r\\nThe diagnosis, if suspected on the basis of family or individual history or physical examination, can be confirmed if the plasma copper-protein ceruloplasmin** is less than 20 mg/dL and either a quantitative determination in a liver biopsy specimen shows an abnormally high concentration of copper (greater than 250 mcg/g dry weight) or Kayser-Fleischer rings are present. \\r\\nTreatment has two objectives: \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n(1)\\r\\n \\r\\n(2)\\r\\nThe first objective is attained by a daily diet that contains no more than 1 or 2 mg of copper. Such a diet should exclude, most importantly, chocolate, nuts, shellfish, mushrooms, liver, molasses, broccoli, and cereals and dietary supplements enriched with copper, and be composed to as great an extent as possible of foods with a low copper content. Distilled or demineralized water should be used if the patient's drinking water contains more than 0.1 mg/L of copper. \\r\\nFor the second objective, a copper chelating agent is used. \\r\\nIn symptomatic patients, this treatment usually produces marked neurologic improvement, fading of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and gradual amelioration of hepatic dysfunction and psychic disturbances. \\r\\nClinical experience to date suggests that life is prolonged with the above regimen. \\r\\nNoticeable improvement may not occur for 1 to 3 months. Occasionally, neurologic symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE. Despite this, the drug should not be withdrawn. Temporary interruption carries an increased risk of developing a sensitivity reaction upon resumption of therapy, although it may result in clinical improvement of neurological symptoms (see \\r\\nWARNINGS\\r\\nTreatment of asymptomatic patients has been carried out for over 30 years. Symptoms and signs of the disease appear to be prevented indefinitely if daily treatment with CUPRIMINE is continued. \\r\\nCystinuria is characterized by excessive urinary excretion of the dibasic amino acids, arginine, lysine, ornithine, and cystine, and the mixed disulfide of cysteine and homocysteine. The metabolic defect that leads to cystinuria is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. Metabolism of the affected amino acids is influenced by at least two abnormal factors: (1) defective gastrointestinal absorption and (2) renal tubular dysfunction. \\r\\nArginine, lysine, ornithine, and cysteine are soluble substances, readily excreted. There is no apparent pathology connected with their excretion in excessive quantities. \\r\\nCystine, however, is so slightly soluble at the usual range of urinary pH that it is not excreted readily, and so crystallizes and forms stones in the urinary tract. Stone formation is the only known pathology in cystinuria. \\r\\nNormal daily output of cystine is 40 to 80 mg. In cystinuria, output is greatly increased and may exceed 1 g/day. At 500 to 600 mg/day, stone formation is almost certain. When it is more than 300 mg/day, treatment is indicated.\\r\\nConventional treatment is directed at keeping urinary cystine diluted enough to prevent stone formation, keeping the urine alkaline enough to dissolve as much cystine as possible, and minimizing cystine production by a diet low in methionine (the major dietary precursor of cystine). Patients must drink enough fluid to keep urine-specific gravity below 1.010, take enough alkali to keep urinary pH at 7.5 to 8, and maintain a diet low in methionine. This diet is not recommended in growing children and probably is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its low protein content (see \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS\\r\\nWhen these measures are inadequate to control recurrent stone formation, CUPRIMINE may be used as additional therapy, and when patients refuse to adhere to conventional treatment, CUPRIMINE may be a useful substitute. It is capable of keeping cystine excretion to near normal values, thereby hindering stone formation and the serious consequences of pyelonephritis and impaired renal function that develop in some patients. Bartter and colleagues depict the process by which penicillamine interacts with cystine to form penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide as:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC + PS'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCS' + CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPSSP + CS'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPS' + CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC + PSSP'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n2CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC = cystine\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCS' = deprotonated cysteine\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPSSP = penicillamine disulfide\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPS' = deprotonated penicillamine sulfhydryl\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSP = penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide\\r\\nIn this process, it is assumed that the deprotonated form of penicillamine, PS', is the active factor in bringing about the disulfide interchange. \\r\\nBecause CUPRIMINE can cause severe adverse reactions, its use in rheumatoid arthritis should be restricted to patients who have severe, active disease and who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Even then, benefit-to-risk ratio should be carefully considered. Other measures, such as rest, physiotherapy, salicylates, and corticosteroids, should be used, when indicated, in conjunction with CUPRIMINE (see \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS</td>\n",

       "      <td>Isoniazid oral solution is recommended for all forms of tuberculosis in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant anti-tuberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Single-drug treatment of active tuberculosis with isoniazid or any other medication is inadequate therapy.\\r\\nIsoniazid oral solution is recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis):\\r\\n \\r\\nPersons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (greater than or equal to 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin-negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy.\\r\\nClose contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). In addition, tuberculin-negative (less than 5 mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of infectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive (greater than 5 mm), therapy should be continued.\\r\\nRecent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (greater than or equal to 10 mm increase within a 2-year period for those less than 35 years old; greater than or equal to 15 mm increase for those greater than or equal to 35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a greater than 10 mm skin test are included in this category.\\r\\nPersons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly.\\r\\nIntravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (greater than 10 mm).\\r\\nPersons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorticosteroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin's disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic undernutrition (including: intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state [with or without weight loss], chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly.\\r\\nAdditionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following high-incidence groups:\\r\\n \\r\\nForeign-born persons from high-prevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine.\\r\\nMedically underserved low-income populations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans.\\r\\nResidents of facilities for long-term care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes and mental institutions).\\r\\nChildren who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have greater than 10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test.\\r\\nFinally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (1 to 6); b) belong to none of the high-incidence groups; and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy.\\r\\nThe risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (1 to 6) and on an individual basis in situations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected.</td>\n",

Use of sympathomimetics and compounds such as guanethidine, methyldopa, methylphenidate, reserpine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylalanine, dopamine, levodopa, tyrosine, and tryptophan with Marplan may precipitate hypertension, headache, and related symptoms. The combination of MAO inhibitors and tryptophan has been reported to cause behavioral and neurologic symptoms, including disorientation, confusion, amnesia, delirium, agitation, hypomanic signs, ataxia, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, shivering, ocular oscillations, and Babinski signs.\\r\\nMeperidine should not be used concomitantly with MAO inhibitors or within 2 or 3 weeks following MAO therapy. Serious reactions have been precipitated with concomitant use, including coma, severe hypertension or hypotension, severe respiratory depression, convulsions, malignant hyperpyrexia, excitation, peripheral vascular collapse, and death. It is thought that these reactions may be mediated by accumulation of 5-HT (serotonin) consequent to MAO inhibition.\\r\\nMarplan should not be used in combination with dextromethorphan. The combination of MAO inhibitors and dextromethorphan has been reported to cause brief episodes of psychosis or bizarre behavior.\\r\\nHypertensive crises have sometimes occurred during Marplan therapy after ingestion of foods with a high tyramine content. In general, patients should avoid protein foods in which aging or protein breakdown is used to increase flavor. In particular, patients should be instructed not to take foods such as cheese (particularly strong or aged varieties), sour cream, Chianti wine, sherry, beer (including non-alcoholic beer), liqueurs, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, liver, canned figs, raisins, bananas or avocados (particularly if overripe), chocolate, soy sauce, sauerkraut, the pods of broad beans (fava beans), yeast extracts, yogurt, meat extracts, meat prepared with tenderizers, or dry sausage.\\r\\nPatients taking Marplan should not undergo elective surgery requiring general anesthesia. Also, they should not be given cocaine or local anesthesia containing sympathomimetic vasoconstrictors. The possible combined hypotensive effects of Marplan and spinal anesthesia should be kept in mind. Marplan should be discontinued at least 10 days before elective surgery.\\r\\nMarplan should not be used in combination with some central nervous system depressants, such as narcotics, barbiturates, or alcohol. \\r\\nMarplan should not be used in combination with antihypertensive agents, including thiazide diuretics. A marked potentiating effect on these drugs has been reported, resulting in hypotension.\\r\\nExcessive use of caffeine in any form should be avoided in patients receiving Marplan.   \n",
       "1  Marplan is indicated for the treatment of depression. Because of its potentially serious side effects, Marplan is not an antidepressant of first choice in the treatment of newly diagnosed depressed patients.\\r\\nThe efficacy of Marplan in the treatment of depression was established in 6-week controlled trials of depressed outpatients. These patients had symptoms that corresponded to the DSM-IV category of major depressive disorder; however, they often also had signs and symptoms of anxiety (anxious mood, panic, and/or phobic symptoms) \\r\\n(\\r\\nsee \\r\\n \\r\\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\\r\\n).\\r\\nA major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.\\r\\nThe antidepressant effectiveness of Marplan in hospitalized depressed patients, or in endogenomorphically retarded and delusionally depressed patients, has not been adequately studied.\\r\\nThe effectiveness of Marplan in long-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Marplan for extended periods should periodically evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

       "2  CUPRIMINE is indicated in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and in patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Available evidence suggests that CUPRIMINE is not of value in ankylosing spondylitis. \\r\\nWilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) occurs in individuals who have inherited an autosomal-recessive defect that leads to an accumulation of copper far in excess of metabolic requirements. The excess copper is deposited in several organs and tissues, and eventually produces pathological effects primarily in the liver, where damage progresses to postnecrotic cirrhosis, and in the brain, where degeneration is widespread. Copper is also deposited as characteristic, asymptomatic, golden-brown Kayser-Fleischer rings in the corneas of all patients with cerebral symptomatology and some patients who are either asymptomatic or manifest only hepatic symptomatology. \\r\\nTwo types of patients require treatment for Wilson's disease: (1) the symptomatic, and (2) the asymptomatic in whom it can be assumed the disease will develop in the future if the patient is not treated. \\r\\nThe diagnosis, if suspected on the basis of family or individual history or physical examination, can be confirmed if the plasma copper-protein ceruloplasmin** is less than 20 mg/dL and either a quantitative determination in a liver biopsy specimen shows an abnormally high concentration of copper (greater than 250 mcg/g dry weight) or Kayser-Fleischer rings are present. \\r\\nTreatment has two objectives: \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n(1)\\r\\n \\r\\n(2)\\r\\nThe first objective is attained by a daily diet that contains no more than 1 or 2 mg of copper. Such a diet should exclude, most importantly, chocolate, nuts, shellfish, mushrooms, liver, molasses, broccoli, and cereals and dietary supplements enriched with copper, and be composed to as great an extent as possible of foods with a low copper content. Distilled or demineralized water should be used if the patient's drinking water contains more than 0.1 mg/L of copper. \\r\\nFor the second objective, a copper chelating agent is used. \\r\\nIn symptomatic patients, this treatment usually produces marked neurologic improvement, fading of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and gradual amelioration of hepatic dysfunction and psychic disturbances. \\r\\nClinical experience to date suggests that life is prolonged with the above regimen. \\r\\nNoticeable improvement may not occur for 1 to 3 months. Occasionally, neurologic symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE. Despite this, the drug should not be withdrawn. Temporary interruption carries an increased risk of developing a sensitivity reaction upon resumption of therapy, although it may result in clinical improvement of neurological symptoms (see \\r\\nWARNINGS\\r\\nTreatment of asymptomatic patients has been carried out for over 30 years. Symptoms and signs of the disease appear to be prevented indefinitely if daily treatment with CUPRIMINE is continued. \\r\\nCystinuria is characterized by excessive urinary excretion of the dibasic amino acids, arginine, lysine, ornithine, and cystine, and the mixed disulfide of cysteine and homocysteine. The metabolic defect that leads to cystinuria is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. Metabolism of the affected amino acids is influenced by at least two abnormal factors: (1) defective gastrointestinal absorption and (2) renal tubular dysfunction. \\r\\nArginine, lysine, ornithine, and cysteine are soluble substances, readily excreted. There is no apparent pathology connected with their excretion in excessive quantities. \\r\\nCystine, however, is so slightly soluble at the usual range of urinary pH that it is not excreted readily, and so crystallizes and forms stones in the urinary tract. Stone formation is the only known pathology in cystinuria. \\r\\nNormal daily output of cystine is 40 to 80 mg. In cystinuria, output is greatly increased and may exceed 1 g/day. At 500 to 600 mg/day, stone formation is almost certain. When it is more than 300 mg/day, treatment is indicated.\\r\\nConventional treatment is directed at keeping urinary cystine diluted enough to prevent stone formation, keeping the urine alkaline enough to dissolve as much cystine as possible, and minimizing cystine production by a diet low in methionine (the major dietary precursor of cystine). Patients must drink enough fluid to keep urine-specific gravity below 1.010, take enough alkali to keep urinary pH at 7.5 to 8, and maintain a diet low in methionine. This diet is not recommended in growing children and probably is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its low protein content (see \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS\\r\\nWhen these measures are inadequate to control recurrent stone formation, CUPRIMINE may be used as additional therapy, and when patients refuse to adhere to conventional treatment, CUPRIMINE may be a useful substitute. It is capable of keeping cystine excretion to near normal values, thereby hindering stone formation and the serious consequences of pyelonephritis and impaired renal function that develop in some patients. Bartter and colleagues depict the process by which penicillamine interacts with cystine to form penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide as:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC + PS'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCS' + CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPSSP + CS'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPS' + CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC + PSSP'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n2CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC = cystine\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCS' = deprotonated cysteine\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPSSP = penicillamine disulfide\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPS' = deprotonated penicillamine sulfhydryl\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSP = penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide\\r\\nIn this process, it is assumed that the deprotonated form of penicillamine, PS', is the active factor in bringing about the disulfide interchange. \\r\\nBecause CUPRIMINE can cause severe adverse reactions, its use in rheumatoid arthritis should be restricted to patients who have severe, active disease and who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Even then, benefit-to-risk ratio should be carefully considered. Other measures, such as rest, physiotherapy, salicylates, and corticosteroids, should be used, when indicated, in conjunction with CUPRIMINE (see \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "4  Isoniazid oral solution is recommended for all forms of tuberculosis in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant anti-tuberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Single-drug treatment of active tuberculosis with isoniazid or any other medication is inadequate therapy.\\r\\nIsoniazid oral solution is recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis):\\r\\n \\r\\nPersons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (greater than or equal to 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin-negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy.\\r\\nClose contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). In addition, tuberculin-negative (less than 5 mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of infectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive (greater than 5 mm), therapy should be continued.\\r\\nRecent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (greater than or equal to 10 mm increase within a 2-year period for those less than 35 years old; greater than or equal to 15 mm increase for those greater than or equal to 35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a greater than 10 mm skin test are included in this category.\\r\\nPersons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly.\\r\\nIntravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (greater than 10 mm).\\r\\nPersons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorticosteroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin's disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic undernutrition (including: intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state [with or without weight loss], chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly.\\r\\nAdditionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following high-incidence groups:\\r\\n \\r\\nForeign-born persons from high-prevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine.\\r\\nMedically underserved low-income populations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans.\\r\\nResidents of facilities for long-term care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes and mental institutions).\\r\\nChildren who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have greater than 10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test.\\r\\nFinally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (1 to 6); b) belong to none of the high-incidence groups; and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy.\\r\\nThe risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (1 to 6) and on an individual basis in situations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

(See \\r\\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\r\\nDuring administration of large doses of OMNIPAQUE 350, continuous monitoring of vital signs is desirable. Caution is advised in the administration of large volumes to patients with incipient heart failure because of the possibility of aggravating the preexisting condition. Hypotension should be corrected promptly since it may induce serious arrhythmias. Special care regarding dosage should be observed in patients with right ventricular failure, pulmonary hypertension, or stenotic pulmonary vascular beds because of the hemodynamic changes which may occur after injection into the right heart outflow tract. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nPediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.\\r\\nCardiovascular system reactions in angiocardiography included angina (8%), hypotension (2.5%), bradycardia (1%), and tachycardia (1%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe individual dose or volume is determined by the size of the structure to be visualized, the anticipated degree of hemodilution, and valvular competence. Weight is a minor consideration in adults, but must be considered in infants and young pediatric patients. The volume of each individual injection is a more important consideration than the total dosage used. When large individual volumes are administered, as in ventriculography and aortography, it has been suggested that several minutes be permitted to elapse between each injection to allow for subsidence of possible hemodynamic disturbances.\\r\\nThe recommended single injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for angiocardiographic procedures in adults and the recommended single injection volumes of OMNIPAQUE 350 and OMNIPAQUE 300 for angiographic procedures in pediatric patients are as follows:\\r\\nThe usual adult volume for a single injection is 40 mL with a range of 30 mL to 60 mL. This may be repeated as necessary. When combined with selective coronary arteriography, the total administered volume should not exceed 250 mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose of OMNIPAQUE 350 is 1.25 mL/kg of body weight with a range of 1 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. For OMNIPAQUE 300 the usual single injection dose is 1.75 mL/kg with a range of 1.5 mL/kg to 2.0 mL/kg. When multiple injections are given, the total administered dose should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.\\r\\nThe usual adult volume for right or left coronary arteriography is 5 mL (range 3 mL to 14 mL) per injection.\\r\\nThe usual adult single injection volume is 50 mL, with a range of 20 mL to 75 mL.\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose is 1 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350.\\r\\nThe visualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.\\r\\nLarge doses of OMNIPAQUE 350 were well tolerated in angiographic procedures requiring multiple injections.\\r\\nThe maximum total volume for multiple procedures should not exceed 250 mL of 350 mg Iodine/mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nVisualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.\\r\\nThe maximum total dose for multiple injection procedures should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or 6 mL/kg up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL and OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL are indicated in adults for use in aortography and selective visceral arteriography including studies of the aortic arch, ascending aorta, and abdominal aorta and its branches (celiac, mesenteric, renal, hepatic and splenic arteries).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for use in aortography including studies of the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending and descending aorta.\\r\\nUnder conditions of slowed aortic circulation there is an increased likelihood for aortography to cause muscle spasm. Occasional serious neurologic complications, including paraplegia, have also been reported in patients with aortoiliac obstruction, femoral artery obstruction, abdominal compression, hypotension, hypertension, spinal anesthesia, and injection of vasopressors to increase contrast. In these patients the concentration, volume and number of repeat injections of the medium should be maintained at a minimum with appropriate intervals between injections. The position of the patient and catheter tip should be carefully monitored.\\r\\nEntry of a large aortic dose into the renal artery may cause, even in the absence of symptoms, albuminuria, hematuria, and an elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen. Rapid and complete return of function usually follows. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS ANGIOCARDIOGRAPHY\\r\\nThe usual adult volume as a single injection is 50 mL to 80 mL for the aorta, 30 mL to 60 mL for major branches including celiac and mesenteric arteries, and 5 mL to 15 mL for renal arteries. Repeated injections may be performed if indicated, but the total volume should not exceed 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300 or 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose is 1.0 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350 and should not exceed 5.0 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in cerebral arteriography.\\r\\nThe degree of pain and flushing as the result of the use of OMNIPAQUE 300 in cerebral arteriography is less than that seen with comparable injections of many contrast media.\\r\\nIn cerebral arteriography, patients should be appropriately prepared consistent with existing or suspected disease states.\\r\\nCerebral arteriography should be undertaken with extreme care with special caution in elderly patients, patients in poor clinical condition, advanced arteriosclerosis, severe arterial hypertension, recent cerebral embolism or thrombosis, and cardiac decompensation.\\r\\nSince the contrast medium is given by rapid injection, the patient should be monitored for possible untoward reactions. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nCerebral arteriography with water-soluble contrast media has been associated with temporary neurologic complications including seizures, drowsiness, transient paresis, and mild disturbances in vision such as photomas of 1-second or less duration.\\r\\nCentral nervous system reactions in cerebral arteriography included photomas (15%), headache (5.5%), and pain (4.5%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is recommended for cerebral arteriography at the following volumes: common carotid artery (6 mL to 12 mL), internal carotid artery (8 mL to 10 mL), external carotid artery (6 mL to 9 mL), and vertebral artery (6 mL to 10 mL).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in intravenous digital subtraction angiography (I.V.DSA) of the vessels of the head, neck, and abdominal, renal and peripheral vessels.\\r\\nArteriograms of diagnostic quality can be obtained following the intravenous administration of contrast media employing digital subtraction and computer imaging enhancement techniques. The intravenous route of administration using these techniques has the advantage of being less invasive than the corresponding selective catheter placement of medium. The dose is administered into a peripheral vein, the superior vena cava or right atrium, usually by mechanical injection although sometimes by rapid manual injection. The technique has been used to visualize the ventricles, aorta and most of its larger branches, including the carotids, cerebrals, vertebrals, renal, celiac, mesenterics, and the major peripheral vessels of the limbs. Radiographic visualization of these structures is possible until significant hemodilution occurs.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 can be injected intravenously as a rapid bolus to provide arterial visualization using digital subtraction radiography. Preprocedural medications are not considered necessary. OMNIPAQUE 350 has provided diagnostic arterial radiographs in about 95% of patients. In some cases, poor arterial visualization has been attributed to patient movement. OMNIPAQUE 350 is very well tolerated in the vascular system. Patient discomfort (general sensation of heat and/or pain) following injection is less than with various other contrast media.\\r\\nSince the contrast medium is usually administered mechanically under high pressure, rupture of smaller peripheral veins can occur. It has been suggested that this can be avoided by using an intravenous catheter threaded proximally beyond larger tributaries or, in the case of the antecubital vein, into the superior vena cava. Sometimes the femoral vein is used. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nCardiovascular system reactions in digital arteriography included transient PVCs (16%) and PACs (6.5%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe usual injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for the intravenous digital technique is 30 mL to 50 mL of a 350 mg Iodine/mL solution. This is administered as a bolus at 7.5 to 30 mL/second using a pressure injector. The volume and rate of injection will depend primarily on the type of equipment and technique used.\\r\\nFrequently three or more injections may be required, up to a total volume not to exceed 250 mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral arteriography. OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral venography.\\r\\nSedative medication may be employed prior to use. Anesthesia is not considered necessary. Patient discomfort during and immediately following injection is substantially less than that following injection of various other contrast media. Moderate to severe discomfort is very unusual.\\r\\nPulsation should be present in the artery to be injected. In thromboangiitis obliterans, or ascending infection associated with severe ischemia, angiography should be performed with extreme caution, if at all. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nA transient sensation of mild warmth is usual, immediately following injection. This has not interfered with the procedure.\\r\\nIn phlebography the incidence of leg pain was 21%. This usually was mild and lasted a short time after injection. (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe volume required will depend on the size, flow rate, and disease state of the injected vessel and on the size and condition of the patient, as well as the imaging technique used.

(See \\r\\nSection III\\r\\nFor pharmacokinetics of excretion in adults, see \\r\\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY--Intravascular\\r\\nPreparatory dehydration is not recommended in the elderly, pediatric patients, diabetic or azotemic patients, or in patients with suspected myelomatosis.\\r\\nPediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.\\r\\nSince there is a possibility of temporary suppression of urine formation, it is recommended that a suitable interval elapse before excretory urography is repeated, especially in patients with unilateral or bilateral reduction in renal function. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 at dosages from 200 mg Iodine/kg body weight to 350 mg Iodine/kg body weight have produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory system in patients with normal renal function.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at doses of 0.5 mL/kg to 3 mL/kg of body weight has produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory tract. The usual dose for pediatric patients is 1 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. Dosage for pediatric patients should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 have osmolalities from approximately 2.4 to 3 times that of plasma (285 mOsm/kg water) and are hypertonic under conditions of use.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 is indicated in adults for arthrography and oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in adults for arthrography and hysterosalpingography.

OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in adults for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen. Dilute oral plus intravenous OMNIPAQUE may be useful when unenhanced imaging does not provide sufficient delineation between normal loops of the bowel and adjacent organs or areas of suspected pathology.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered orally or rectally is indicated in pediatric patients for use in examination of the gastrointestinal tract. OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in pediatric patients for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nOral administration of OMNIPAQUE is most often associated with mild, transient diarrhea especially when high concentrations and large volumes are administered. Nausea, vomiting, and moderate diarrhea have also been reported following orally administered OMNIPAQUE, but much less frequently. For CT examinations using dilute oral plus intravenous contrast medium, adverse events are more likely to be associated with the intravenous injection than the hypotonic oral solution. It should be noted that serious or anaphylactoid reactions that may occur with intravascular iodinated media are possible following administration by other routes.\\r\\nIn controlled clinical trials involving 54 adult patients for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 350, the following adverse reactions were reported:\\r\\ndiarrhea (42%), nausea (15%), vomiting (11%), abdominal pain (7%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%). In controlled clinical studies involving 44 adult patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (2%). \\r\\nIn controlled clinical studies involving 58 pediatric patients for examination of the gastrointestinal tract at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL, the following adverse reactions were reported: diarrhea (36%), vomiting (9%), nausea (5%), fever (5%), hypotension (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and urticaria (2%). In clinical studies an increased frequency and severity of diarrhea was noted with an increase in the administered concentration and dose of the radiocontrast agent. In controlled clinical studies involving 69 pediatric patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (1.4%).\\r\\nThe recommended dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract in adults is 50 mL to 100 mL depending on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. The recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen in adults is 500 mL to 1000 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). In conjunction with dilute oral administration, the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 intravenously is 100 mL to 150 mL. The oral dose is administered about 20 to 40 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.\\r\\nThe dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL, is dependent on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. Based on clinical experience, it is recommended that OMNIPAQUE 180 (available in single use vials), be used in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age. OMNIPAQUE 300 may be used in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older.\\r\\nThe following dosage guidelines are recommended:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAge\\r\\nVolume of OMNIPAQUE\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLess than 3 months\\r\\n5 -- 30 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nThree months to 3 years\\r\\nUp to 60 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nFour years to 10 years\\r\\nUp to 80 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nGreater than 10 years\\r\\nUp to 100 mL\\r\\nWhen given rectally, larger volumes may be used.\\r\\nThe recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL for contrast computed tomography of the abdomen in pediatric patients is 180 mL to 750 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). The total oral dose in grams of iodine should generally not exceed 5 g Iodine for pediatric patients under 3 years of age and 10 g Iodine for pediatric patients from 3 to 18 years of age. The oral dosage may be given all at once or over a period of 30 to 45 minutes if there is difficulty in consuming the required volume. In conjunction with dilute oral administration the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 2mL/kg when administered intravenously with a range of 1 mL/kg to 2 mL/kg. Dosage pediatric patients should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total intravenously administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg.

Arthrography may be helpful in the diagnosis of posttraumatic or degenerative joint diseases, synovial rupture, the visualization of communicating bursae or cysts, and in meniscography.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nStrict aseptic technique is required to prevent infection. Fluoroscopic control should be used to ensure proper needle placement, prevent extracapsular injection, and prevent dilution of contrast medium. Undue pressure should not be exerted during injection.\\r\\nInjection of OMNIPAQUE into the joint is associated with transient discomfort, ie, pain, swelling. However, delayed, severe or persistent discomfort may occur occasionally. Severe pain may often result from undue use of pressure or the injection of large volumes. Joint swelling after injection is less with OMNIPAQUE than with high osmolar ionic contrast medium. These types of reactions are generally procedurally dependent and of greater frequency when double-contrast technique is employed.\\r\\n \\r\\nNervous system:\\r\\n \\r\\nSkin and appendages:\\r\\nArthrography is usually performed under local anesthesia. The amount of OMNIPAQUE injected is dependent on the size of the joint to be examined and the technique employed. Lower volumes of contrast medium are usually injected for knee and shoulder arthrography when double-contrast examinations using 15 mL to 100 mL of air are performed.\\r\\nThe following concentrations and volumes are recommended for normal adult knee, shoulder, and temporomandibular joints but should serve as guidelines since joints may require more or less contrast medium for optimal visualization.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nKNEE\\r\\n \\r\\nLower volumes recommended for double-contrast examinations; higher volumes recommended for single-contrast examinations.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSHOULDER\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR\\r\\nPassive or active manipulation is used to disperse the medium throughout the joint space.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the internal group of adult female reproductive organs; ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina.

The procedure is also contraindicated for pregnant women or for those in whom pregnancy is suspected. Its use is not advised for 6 months after termination of pregnancy or 30 days after conization or curettage.\\r\\nIn patients with carcinoma or in those in whom the condition is suspected, caution should be exercised to avoid possible spreading of the lesion by the procedure.\\r\\nInjection of OMNIPAQUE in hysterosalpingography is associated with immediate but transient pain. The cause of the pain may be due as much to the procedure itself as to the contrast medium injected, therefore attention should be paid to the injection pressure and volume instilled to avoid disruptive distention of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluoroscopic monitoring is recommended.\\r\\n \\r\\nNervous system:\\r\\n \\r\\nGastrointestinal system:\\r\\nThe recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 15 mL to 20 mL but will vary depending on individual anatomy and/or disease state.</td>\n",

When large individual volumes are administered, as in ventriculography and aortography, it has been suggested that several minutes be permitted to elapse between each injection to allow for subsidence of possible hemodynamic disturbances.\\r\\nThe recommended single injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for angiocardiographic procedures in adults and the recommended single injection volumes of OMNIPAQUE 350 and OMNIPAQUE 300 for angiographic procedures in pediatric patients are as follows:\\r\\nThe usual adult volume for a single injection is 40 mL with a range of 30 mL to 60 mL. This may be repeated as necessary. When combined with selective coronary arteriography, the total administered volume should not exceed 250 mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose of OMNIPAQUE 350 is 1.25 mL/kg of body weight with a range of 1 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. For OMNIPAQUE 300 the usual single injection dose is 1.75 mL/kg with a range of 1.5 mL/kg to 2.0 mL/kg. When multiple injections are given, the total administered dose should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.\\r\\nThe usual adult volume for right or left coronary arteriography is 5 mL (range 3 mL to 14 mL) per injection.\\r\\nThe usual adult single injection volume is 50 mL, with a range of 20 mL to 75 mL.\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose is 1 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350.\\r\\nThe visualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.\\r\\nLarge doses of OMNIPAQUE 350 were well tolerated in angiographic procedures requiring multiple injections.\\r\\nThe maximum total volume for multiple procedures should not exceed 250 mL of 350 mg Iodine/mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nVisualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.\\r\\nThe maximum total dose for multiple injection procedures should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or 6 mL/kg up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL and OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL are indicated in adults for use in aortography and selective visceral arteriography including studies of the aortic arch, ascending aorta, and abdominal aorta and its branches (celiac, mesenteric, renal, hepatic and splenic arteries).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for use in aortography including studies of the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending and descending aorta.\\r\\nUnder conditions of slowed aortic circulation there is an increased likelihood for aortography to cause muscle spasm. Occasional serious neurologic complications, including paraplegia, have also been reported in patients with aortoiliac obstruction, femoral artery obstruction, abdominal compression, hypotension, hypertension, spinal anesthesia, and injection of vasopressors to increase contrast. In these patients the concentration, volume and number of repeat injections of the medium should be maintained at a minimum with appropriate intervals between injections. The position of the patient and catheter tip should be carefully monitored.\\r\\nEntry of a large aortic dose into the renal artery may cause, even in the absence of symptoms, albuminuria, hematuria, and an elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen. Rapid and complete return of function usually follows. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS ANGIOCARDIOGRAPHY\\r\\nThe usual adult volume as a single injection is 50 mL to 80 mL for the aorta, 30 mL to 60 mL for major branches including celiac and mesenteric arteries, and 5 mL to 15 mL for renal arteries. Repeated injections may be performed if indicated, but the total volume should not exceed 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300 or 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose is 1.0 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350 and should not exceed 5.0 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in cerebral arteriography.\\r\\nThe degree of pain and flushing as the result of the use of OMNIPAQUE 300 in cerebral arteriography is less than that seen with comparable injections of many contrast media.\\r\\nIn cerebral arteriography, patients should be appropriately prepared consistent with existing or suspected disease states.\\r\\nCerebral arteriography should be undertaken with extreme care with special caution in elderly patients, patients in poor clinical condition, advanced arteriosclerosis, severe arterial hypertension, recent cerebral embolism or thrombosis, and cardiac decompensation.\\r\\nSince the contrast medium is given by rapid injection, the patient should be monitored for possible untoward reactions. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nCerebral arteriography with water-soluble contrast media has been associated with temporary neurologic complications including seizures, drowsiness, transient paresis, and mild disturbances in vision such as photomas of 1-second or less duration.\\r\\nCentral nervous system reactions in cerebral arteriography included photomas (15%), headache (5.5%), and pain (4.5%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is recommended for cerebral arteriography at the following volumes: common carotid artery (6 mL to 12 mL), internal carotid artery (8 mL to 10 mL), external carotid artery (6 mL to 9 mL), and vertebral artery (6 mL to 10 mL).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in intravenous digital subtraction angiography (I.V.DSA) of the vessels of the head, neck, and abdominal, renal and peripheral vessels.\\r\\nArteriograms of diagnostic quality can be obtained following the intravenous administration of contrast media employing digital subtraction and computer imaging enhancement techniques. The intravenous route of administration using these techniques has the advantage of being less invasive than the corresponding selective catheter placement of medium. The dose is administered into a peripheral vein, the superior vena cava or right atrium, usually by mechanical injection although sometimes by rapid manual injection. The technique has been used to visualize the ventricles, aorta and most of its larger branches, including the carotids, cerebrals, vertebrals, renal, celiac, mesenterics, and the major peripheral vessels of the limbs. Radiographic visualization of these structures is possible until significant hemodilution occurs.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 can be injected intravenously as a rapid bolus to provide arterial visualization using digital subtraction radiography. Preprocedural medications are not considered necessary. OMNIPAQUE 350 has provided diagnostic arterial radiographs in about 95% of patients. In some cases, poor arterial visualization has been attributed to patient movement. OMNIPAQUE 350 is very well tolerated in the vascular system. Patient discomfort (general sensation of heat and/or pain) following injection is less than with various other contrast media.\\r\\nSince the contrast medium is usually administered mechanically under high pressure, rupture of smaller peripheral veins can occur. It has been suggested that this can be avoided by using an intravenous catheter threaded proximally beyond larger tributaries or, in the case of the antecubital vein, into the superior vena cava. Sometimes the femoral vein is used. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nCardiovascular system reactions in digital arteriography included transient PVCs (16%) and PACs (6.5%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe usual injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for the intravenous digital technique is 30 mL to 50 mL of a 350 mg Iodine/mL solution. This is administered as a bolus at 7.5 to 30 mL/second using a pressure injector. The volume and rate of injection will depend primarily on the type of equipment and technique used.\\r\\nFrequently three or more injections may be required, up to a total volume not to exceed 250 mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral arteriography. OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral venography.\\r\\nSedative medication may be employed prior to use. Anesthesia is not considered necessary. Patient discomfort during and immediately following injection is substantially less than that following injection of various other contrast media. Moderate to severe discomfort is very unusual.\\r\\nPulsation should be present in the artery to be injected. In thromboangiitis obliterans, or ascending infection associated with severe ischemia, angiography should be performed with extreme caution, if at all. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nA transient sensation of mild warmth is usual, immediately following injection. This has not interfered with the procedure.\\r\\nIn phlebography the incidence of leg pain was 21%. This usually was mild and lasted a short time after injection. (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe volume required will depend on the size, flow rate, and disease state of the injected vessel and on the size and condition of the patient, as well as the imaging technique used. The dosage recommended for use in peripheral angiography is as follows:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAortofemoral runoffs:\\r\\n20 mL to 70 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 (350 mg Iodine/mL)\\r\\n \\r\\n30 mL to 90 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300 (300 mg Iodine/mL)\\r\\n \\r\\nSelective arteriograms:\\r\\n10 mL to 30 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 (350 mg Iodine/mL)\\r\\n \\r\\nVenography (per leg):\\r\\n40 mL to 100 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300 (300 mg Iodine/mL)\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated for use in adults in excretory urography to provide diagnostic contrast of the urinary tract.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for excretory urography. (See \\r\\nSection III\\r\\nFor pharmacokinetics of excretion in adults, see \\r\\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY--Intravascular\\r\\nPreparatory dehydration is not recommended in the elderly, pediatric patients, diabetic or azotemic patients, or in patients with suspected myelomatosis.\\r\\nPediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.\\r\\nSince there is a possibility of temporary suppression of urine formation, it is recommended that a suitable interval elapse before excretory urography is repeated, especially in patients with unilateral or bilateral reduction in renal function. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 at dosages from 200 mg Iodine/kg body weight to 350 mg Iodine/kg body weight have produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory system in patients with normal renal function.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at doses of 0.5 mL/kg to 3 mL/kg of body weight has produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory tract. The usual dose for pediatric patients is 1 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. Dosage for pediatric patients should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 have osmolalities from approximately 2.4 to 3 times that of plasma (285 mOsm/kg water) and are hypertonic under conditions of use.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 is indicated in adults for arthrography and oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in adults for arthrography and hysterosalpingography. OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously is indicated in adults for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in pediatric patients for examination of the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 50 mg Iodine/mL to 100 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for voiding cystourethrography.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in pediatric patients for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract. OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in adults for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen. Dilute oral plus intravenous OMNIPAQUE may be useful when unenhanced imaging does not provide sufficient delineation between normal loops of the bowel and adjacent organs or areas of suspected pathology.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered orally or rectally is indicated in pediatric patients for use in examination of the gastrointestinal tract. OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in pediatric patients for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nOral administration of OMNIPAQUE is most often associated with mild, transient diarrhea especially when high concentrations and large volumes are administered. Nausea, vomiting, and moderate diarrhea have also been reported following orally administered OMNIPAQUE, but much less frequently. For CT examinations using dilute oral plus intravenous contrast medium, adverse events are more likely to be associated with the intravenous injection than the hypotonic oral solution. It should be noted that serious or anaphylactoid reactions that may occur with intravascular iodinated media are possible following administration by other routes.\\r\\nIn controlled clinical trials involving 54 adult patients for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 350, the following adverse reactions were reported:\\r\\ndiarrhea (42%), nausea (15%), vomiting (11%), abdominal pain (7%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%). In controlled clinical studies involving 44 adult patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (2%). \\r\\nIn controlled clinical studies involving 58 pediatric patients for examination of the gastrointestinal tract at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL, the following adverse reactions were reported: diarrhea (36%), vomiting (9%), nausea (5%), fever (5%), hypotension (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and urticaria (2%). In clinical studies an increased frequency and severity of diarrhea was noted with an increase in the administered concentration and dose of the radiocontrast agent. In controlled clinical studies involving 69 pediatric patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (1.4%).\\r\\nThe recommended dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract in adults is 50 mL to 100 mL depending on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. The recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen in adults is 500 mL to 1000 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). In conjunction with dilute oral administration, the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 intravenously is 100 mL to 150 mL. The oral dose is administered about 20 to 40 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.\\r\\nThe dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL, is dependent on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. Based on clinical experience, it is recommended that OMNIPAQUE 180 (available in single use vials), be used in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age. OMNIPAQUE 300 may be used in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older.\\r\\nThe following dosage guidelines are recommended:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAge\\r\\nVolume of OMNIPAQUE\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLess than 3 months\\r\\n5 -- 30 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nThree months to 3 years\\r\\nUp to 60 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nFour years to 10 years\\r\\nUp to 80 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nGreater than 10 years\\r\\nUp to 100 mL\\r\\nWhen given rectally, larger volumes may be used.\\r\\nThe recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL for contrast computed tomography of the abdomen in pediatric patients is 180 mL to 750 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). The total oral dose in grams of iodine should generally not exceed 5 g Iodine for pediatric patients under 3 years of age and 10 g Iodine for pediatric patients from 3 to 18 years of age. The oral dosage may be given all at once or over a period of 30 to 45 minutes if there is difficulty in consuming the required volume. In conjunction with dilute oral administration the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 2mL/kg when administered intravenously with a range of 1 mL/kg to 2 mL/kg. Dosage pediatric patients should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total intravenously administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg. The oral dose is administered about 30 to 60 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE may be diluted with water or beverage as follows:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTo Achieve\\r\\nAdd\\r\\nTo\\r\\n \\r\\nOne Liter of Contrast Medium at A Final Concentration\\r\\nStock Concentration of OMNIPAQUE\\r\\nVolume\\r\\nWater, Carbonated Beverage, Milk, or Juice\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n6\\r\\n300\\r\\n20\\r\\n980\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n17\\r\\n983\\r\\n \\r\\n9\\r\\n300\\r\\n30\\r\\n970\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n26\\r\\n974\\r\\n \\r\\n12\\r\\n300\\r\\n40\\r\\n960\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n35\\r\\n965\\r\\n \\r\\n15\\r\\n300\\r\\n50\\r\\n950\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n43\\r\\n957\\r\\n \\r\\n18\\r\\n300\\r\\n60\\r\\n940\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n52\\r\\n948\\r\\n \\r\\n21\\r\\n300\\r\\n70\\r\\n930\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n60\\r\\n940\\r\\nDilutions of OMNIPAQUE should be prepared just prior to use and any unused portion discarded after the procedure.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 50 mg Iodine/mL to 100 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for voiding cystourethrography. VCUs are often performed in conjunction with excretory urography.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSince the VCU procedure requires instrumentation, special precautions should be observed in those patients known to have an acute urinary tract infection. Filling of the bladder should be done at a steady rate, exercising caution to avoid excessive pressure. Sterile procedures are essential.\\r\\n \\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE may be diluted, utilizing aseptic technique, with Sterile Water for Injection to a concentration of 50 mg Iodine/mL to 100 mg Iodine/mL for voiding cystourethrography. The concentration may vary depending upon the patient's size and age and also with the technique and equipment used. Sufficient volume of contrast medium should be administered to adequately fill the bladder. The usual volume ranges from 50 mL to 300 mL of OMNIPAQUE at a concentration of 100 mg Iodine/mL and 50 mL to 600 mL of OMNIPAQUE at a concentration of 50 mg Iodine/mL.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE may be diluted with Sterile Water for Injection as indicated in the table below:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTo Achieve\\r\\nAdd To\\r\\n \\r\\nA Final Concentration\\r\\nEach 100 mL of OMNIPAQUE Sterile Water for Injection, USP (mL)\\r\\n \\r\\n(mg Iodine/mL)\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n100\\r\\n200\\r\\n250\\r\\n \\r\\n90\\r\\n233\\r\\n289\\r\\n \\r\\n80\\r\\n275\\r\\n338\\r\\n \\r\\n70\\r\\n330\\r\\n400\\r\\n \\r\\n60\\r\\n400\\r\\n483\\r\\n \\r\\n50\\r\\n500\\r\\n600\\r\\nDilutions of OMNIPAQUE should be prepared just prior to use and any unused portion discarded after the procedure.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the knee joint in adults, and OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the shoulder joint in adults, and OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the temporomandibular joint in adults. Arthrography may be helpful in the diagnosis of posttraumatic or degenerative joint diseases, synovial rupture, the visualization of communicating bursae or cysts, and in meniscography.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nStrict aseptic technique is required to prevent infection. Fluoroscopic control should be used to ensure proper needle placement, prevent extracapsular injection, and prevent dilution of contrast medium. Undue pressure should not be exerted during injection.\\r\\nInjection of OMNIPAQUE into the joint is associated with transient discomfort, ie, pain, swelling. However, delayed, severe or persistent discomfort may occur occasionally. Severe pain may often result from undue use of pressure or the injection of large volumes. Joint swelling after injection is less with OMNIPAQUE than with high osmolar ionic contrast medium. These types of reactions are generally procedurally dependent and of greater frequency when double-contrast technique is employed.\\r\\n \\r\\nNervous system:\\r\\n \\r\\nSkin and appendages:\\r\\nArthrography is usually performed under local anesthesia. The amount of OMNIPAQUE injected is dependent on the size of the joint to be examined and the technique employed. Lower volumes of contrast medium are usually injected for knee and shoulder arthrography when double-contrast examinations using 15 mL to 100 mL of air are performed.\\r\\nThe following concentrations and volumes are recommended for normal adult knee, shoulder, and temporomandibular joints but should serve as guidelines since joints may require more or less contrast medium for optimal visualization.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nKNEE\\r\\n \\r\\nLower volumes recommended for double-contrast examinations; higher volumes recommended for single-contrast examinations.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSHOULDER\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR\\r\\nPassive or active manipulation is used to disperse the medium throughout the joint space.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the internal group of adult female reproductive organs; ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. Hysterosalpingography is utilized as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality in the treatment of infertility and other abnormal gynecological conditions.\\r\\nThe procedure should not be performed during the menstrual period or when menstrual flow is imminent, nor should it be performed when infection is present in any portion of the genital tract, including the external genitalia. The procedure is also contraindicated for pregnant women or for those in whom pregnancy is suspected. Its use is not advised for 6 months after termination of pregnancy or 30 days after conization or curettage.\\r\\nIn patients with carcinoma or in those in whom the condition is suspected, caution should be exercised to avoid possible spreading of the lesion by the procedure.\\r\\nInjection of OMNIPAQUE in hysterosalpingography is associated with immediate but transient pain. The cause of the pain may be due as much to the procedure itself as to the contrast medium injected, therefore attention should be paid to the injection pressure and volume instilled to avoid disruptive distention of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluoroscopic monitoring is recommended.\\r\\n \\r\\nNervous system:\\r\\n \\r\\nGastrointestinal system:\\r\\nThe recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 15 mL to 20 mL but will vary depending on individual anatomy and/or disease state.</td>\n",

       "0  OMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated for intrathecal administration in adults including myelography (lumbar, thoracic, cervical, total columnar) and in contrast enhancement for computerized tomography (myelography, cisternography, ventriculography).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 is indicated in adults for angiocardiography (ventriculography, selective coronary arteriography), aortography including studies of the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending aorta, abdominal aorta and its branches, intravenous digital subtraction angiography of the head, neck, abdominal, renal and peripheral vessels, peripheral arteriography, and excretory urography.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 is indicated in pediatric patients for angiocardiography (ventriculography, pulmonary arteriography, and venography; studies of the collateral arteries and aortography, including the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending and descending aorta). OMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in adults for aortography including studies of the aortic arch, abdominal aorta and its branches, cerebral arteriography, peripheral venography (phlebography), and excretory urography.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in pediatric patients for angiocardiography (ventriculography), excretory urography.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for angiocardiography (ventriculography, aortic root injections, and selective coronary arteriography). OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for angiocardiography (ventriculography, pulmonary arteriography, and venography, and studies of the collateral arteries).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients pediatric patients for angiocardiography (ventriculography).\\r\\nAfter both ventricular and coronary injection, decreases in systolic pressure were less pronounced and returned to baseline values earlier with OMNIPAQUE 350 than with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 produced less Q-T interval prolongation than seen with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.\\r\\nIn pediatric patients, after injection of all sites, but particularly following ventricular and pulmonary artery injections, decreases in both systolic and diastolic intravascular pressure were significantly less pronounced with OMNIPAQUE 350 than with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection. In pediatric patients OMNIPAQUE 350 produced significantly less shortening of the R-R interval than seen with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.\\r\\nIf repeat injections are made in rapid succession, all these changes are likely to be more pronounced. (See \\r\\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\r\\nDuring administration of large doses of OMNIPAQUE 350, continuous monitoring of vital signs is desirable. Caution is advised in the administration of large volumes to patients with incipient heart failure because of the possibility of aggravating the preexisting condition. Hypotension should be corrected promptly since it may induce serious arrhythmias. Special care regarding dosage should be observed in patients with right ventricular failure, pulmonary hypertension, or stenotic pulmonary vascular beds because of the hemodynamic changes which may occur after injection into the right heart outflow tract. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nPediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.\\r\\nCardiovascular system reactions in angiocardiography included angina (8%), hypotension (2.5%), bradycardia (1%), and tachycardia (1%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe individual dose or volume is determined by the size of the structure to be visualized, the anticipated degree of hemodilution, and valvular competence. Weight is a minor consideration in adults, but must be considered in infants and young pediatric patients. The volume of each individual injection is a more important consideration than the total dosage used. When large individual volumes are administered, as in ventriculography and aortography, it has been suggested that several minutes be permitted to elapse between each injection to allow for subsidence of possible hemodynamic disturbances.\\r\\nThe recommended single injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for angiocardiographic procedures in adults and the recommended single injection volumes of OMNIPAQUE 350 and OMNIPAQUE 300 for angiographic procedures in pediatric patients are as follows:\\r\\nThe usual adult volume for a single injection is 40 mL with a range of 30 mL to 60 mL. This may be repeated as necessary. When combined with selective coronary arteriography, the total administered volume should not exceed 250 mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose of OMNIPAQUE 350 is 1.25 mL/kg of body weight with a range of 1 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. For OMNIPAQUE 300 the usual single injection dose is 1.75 mL/kg with a range of 1.5 mL/kg to 2.0 mL/kg. When multiple injections are given, the total administered dose should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.\\r\\nThe usual adult volume for right or left coronary arteriography is 5 mL (range 3 mL to 14 mL) per injection.\\r\\nThe usual adult single injection volume is 50 mL, with a range of 20 mL to 75 mL.\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose is 1 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350.\\r\\nThe visualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.\\r\\nLarge doses of OMNIPAQUE 350 were well tolerated in angiographic procedures requiring multiple injections.\\r\\nThe maximum total volume for multiple procedures should not exceed 250 mL of 350 mg Iodine/mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nVisualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.\\r\\nThe maximum total dose for multiple injection procedures should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or 6 mL/kg up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL and OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL are indicated in adults for use in aortography and selective visceral arteriography including studies of the aortic arch, ascending aorta, and abdominal aorta and its branches (celiac, mesenteric, renal, hepatic and splenic arteries).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for use in aortography including studies of the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending and descending aorta.\\r\\nUnder conditions of slowed aortic circulation there is an increased likelihood for aortography to cause muscle spasm. Occasional serious neurologic complications, including paraplegia, have also been reported in patients with aortoiliac obstruction, femoral artery obstruction, abdominal compression, hypotension, hypertension, spinal anesthesia, and injection of vasopressors to increase contrast. In these patients the concentration, volume and number of repeat injections of the medium should be maintained at a minimum with appropriate intervals between injections. The position of the patient and catheter tip should be carefully monitored.\\r\\nEntry of a large aortic dose into the renal artery may cause, even in the absence of symptoms, albuminuria, hematuria, and an elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen. Rapid and complete return of function usually follows. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS ANGIOCARDIOGRAPHY\\r\\nThe usual adult volume as a single injection is 50 mL to 80 mL for the aorta, 30 mL to 60 mL for major branches including celiac and mesenteric arteries, and 5 mL to 15 mL for renal arteries. Repeated injections may be performed if indicated, but the total volume should not exceed 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300 or 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose is 1.0 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350 and should not exceed 5.0 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in cerebral arteriography.\\r\\nThe degree of pain and flushing as the result of the use of OMNIPAQUE 300 in cerebral arteriography is less than that seen with comparable injections of many contrast media.\\r\\nIn cerebral arteriography, patients should be appropriately prepared consistent with existing or suspected disease states.\\r\\nCerebral arteriography should be undertaken with extreme care with special caution in elderly patients, patients in poor clinical condition, advanced arteriosclerosis, severe arterial hypertension, recent cerebral embolism or thrombosis, and cardiac decompensation.\\r\\nSince the contrast medium is given by rapid injection, the patient should be monitored for possible untoward reactions. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nCerebral arteriography with water-soluble contrast media has been associated with temporary neurologic complications including seizures, drowsiness, transient paresis, and mild disturbances in vision such as photomas of 1-second or less duration.\\r\\nCentral nervous system reactions in cerebral arteriography included photomas (15%), headache (5.5%), and pain (4.5%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is recommended for cerebral arteriography at the following volumes: common carotid artery (6 mL to 12 mL), internal carotid artery (8 mL to 10 mL), external carotid artery (6 mL to 9 mL), and vertebral artery (6 mL to 10 mL).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in intravenous digital subtraction angiography (I.V.DSA) of the vessels of the head, neck, and abdominal, renal and peripheral vessels.\\r\\nArteriograms of diagnostic quality can be obtained following the intravenous administration of contrast media employing digital subtraction and computer imaging enhancement techniques. The intravenous route of administration using these techniques has the advantage of being less invasive than the corresponding selective catheter placement of medium. The dose is administered into a peripheral vein, the superior vena cava or right atrium, usually by mechanical injection although sometimes by rapid manual injection. The technique has been used to visualize the ventricles, aorta and most of its larger branches, including the carotids, cerebrals, vertebrals, renal, celiac, mesenterics, and the major peripheral vessels of the limbs. Radiographic visualization of these structures is possible until significant hemodilution occurs.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 can be injected intravenously as a rapid bolus to provide arterial visualization using digital subtraction radiography. Preprocedural medications are not considered necessary. OMNIPAQUE 350 has provided diagnostic arterial radiographs in about 95% of patients. In some cases, poor arterial visualization has been attributed to patient movement. OMNIPAQUE 350 is very well tolerated in the vascular system. Patient discomfort (general sensation of heat and/or pain) following injection is less than with various other contrast media.\\r\\nSince the contrast medium is usually administered mechanically under high pressure, rupture of smaller peripheral veins can occur. It has been suggested that this can be avoided by using an intravenous catheter threaded proximally beyond larger tributaries or, in the case of the antecubital vein, into the superior vena cava. Sometimes the femoral vein is used. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nCardiovascular system reactions in digital arteriography included transient PVCs (16%) and PACs (6.5%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe usual injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for the intravenous digital technique is 30 mL to 50 mL of a 350 mg Iodine/mL solution. This is administered as a bolus at 7.5 to 30 mL/second using a pressure injector. The volume and rate of injection will depend primarily on the type of equipment and technique used.\\r\\nFrequently three or more injections may be required, up to a total volume not to exceed 250 mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral arteriography. OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral venography.\\r\\nSedative medication may be employed prior to use. Anesthesia is not considered necessary. Patient discomfort during and immediately following injection is substantially less than that following injection of various other contrast media. Moderate to severe discomfort is very unusual.\\r\\nPulsation should be present in the artery to be injected. In thromboangiitis obliterans, or ascending infection associated with severe ischemia, angiography should be performed with extreme caution, if at all. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nA transient sensation of mild warmth is usual, immediately following injection. This has not interfered with the procedure.\\r\\nIn phlebography the incidence of leg pain was 21%. This usually was mild and lasted a short time after injection. (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe volume required will depend on the size, flow rate, and disease state of the injected vessel and on the size and condition of the patient, as well as the imaging technique used.

(See \\r\\nSection III\\r\\nFor pharmacokinetics of excretion in adults, see \\r\\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY--Intravascular\\r\\nPreparatory dehydration is not recommended in the elderly, pediatric patients, diabetic or azotemic patients, or in patients with suspected myelomatosis.\\r\\nPediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.\\r\\nSince there is a possibility of temporary suppression of urine formation, it is recommended that a suitable interval elapse before excretory urography is repeated, especially in patients with unilateral or bilateral reduction in renal function. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 at dosages from 200 mg Iodine/kg body weight to 350 mg Iodine/kg body weight have produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory system in patients with normal renal function.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at doses of 0.5 mL/kg to 3 mL/kg of body weight has produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory tract. The usual dose for pediatric patients is 1 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. Dosage for pediatric patients should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 have osmolalities from approximately 2.4 to 3 times that of plasma (285 mOsm/kg water) and are hypertonic under conditions of use.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 is indicated in adults for arthrography and oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in adults for arthrography and hysterosalpingography. OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously is indicated in adults for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in pediatric patients for examination of the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 50 mg Iodine/mL to 100 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for voiding cystourethrography.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in pediatric patients for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract. OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in adults for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.

OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in pediatric patients for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nOral administration of OMNIPAQUE is most often associated with mild, transient diarrhea especially when high concentrations and large volumes are administered. Nausea, vomiting, and moderate diarrhea have also been reported following orally administered OMNIPAQUE, but much less frequently. For CT examinations using dilute oral plus intravenous contrast medium, adverse events are more likely to be associated with the intravenous injection than the hypotonic oral solution. It should be noted that serious or anaphylactoid reactions that may occur with intravascular iodinated media are possible following administration by other routes.\\r\\nIn controlled clinical trials involving 54 adult patients for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 350, the following adverse reactions were reported:\\r\\ndiarrhea (42%), nausea (15%), vomiting (11%), abdominal pain (7%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%). In controlled clinical studies involving 44 adult patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (2%). \\r\\nIn controlled clinical studies involving 58 pediatric patients for examination of the gastrointestinal tract at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL, the following adverse reactions were reported: diarrhea (36%), vomiting (9%), nausea (5%), fever (5%), hypotension (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and urticaria (2%). In clinical studies an increased frequency and severity of diarrhea was noted with an increase in the administered concentration and dose of the radiocontrast agent. In controlled clinical studies involving 69 pediatric patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (1.4%).\\r\\nThe recommended dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract in adults is 50 mL to 100 mL depending on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. The recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen in adults is 500 mL to 1000 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). In conjunction with dilute oral administration, the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 intravenously is 100 mL to 150 mL. The oral dose is administered about 20 to 40 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.\\r\\nThe dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL, is dependent on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. Based on clinical experience, it is recommended that OMNIPAQUE 180 (available in single use vials), be used in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age. OMNIPAQUE 300 may be used in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older.\\r\\nThe following dosage guidelines are recommended:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAge\\r\\nVolume of OMNIPAQUE\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLess than 3 months\\r\\n5 -- 30 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nThree months to 3 years\\r\\nUp to 60 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nFour years to 10 years\\r\\nUp to 80 mL\\r\\n \\r\\nGreater than 10 years\\r\\nUp to 100 mL\\r\\nWhen given rectally, larger volumes may be used.\\r\\nThe recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL for contrast computed tomography of the abdomen in pediatric patients is 180 mL to 750 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). The total oral dose in grams of iodine should generally not exceed 5 g Iodine for pediatric patients under 3 years of age and 10 g Iodine for pediatric patients from 3 to 18 years of age. The oral dosage may be given all at once or over a period of 30 to 45 minutes if there is difficulty in consuming the required volume. In conjunction with dilute oral administration the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 2mL/kg when administered intravenously with a range of 1 mL/kg to 2 mL/kg. Dosage pediatric patients should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total intravenously administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg. The oral dose is administered about 30 to 60 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE may be diluted with water or beverage as follows:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTo Achieve\\r\\nAdd\\r\\nTo\\r\\n \\r\\nOne Liter of Contrast Medium at A Final Concentration\\r\\nStock Concentration of OMNIPAQUE\\r\\nVolume\\r\\nWater, Carbonated Beverage, Milk, or Juice\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n6\\r\\n300\\r\\n20\\r\\n980\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n17\\r\\n983\\r\\n \\r\\n9\\r\\n300\\r\\n30\\r\\n970\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n26\\r\\n974\\r\\n \\r\\n12\\r\\n300\\r\\n40\\r\\n960\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n35\\r\\n965\\r\\n \\r\\n15\\r\\n300\\r\\n50\\r\\n950\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n43\\r\\n957\\r\\n \\r\\n18\\r\\n300\\r\\n60\\r\\n940\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n52\\r\\n948\\r\\n \\r\\n21\\r\\n300\\r\\n70\\r\\n930\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n60\\r\\n940\\r\\nDilutions of OMNIPAQUE should be prepared just prior to use and any unused portion discarded after the procedure.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 50 mg Iodine/mL to 100 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for voiding cystourethrography. VCUs are often performed in conjunction with excretory urography.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSince the VCU procedure requires instrumentation, special precautions should be observed in those patients known to have an acute urinary tract infection.

The concentration may vary depending upon the patient's size and age and also with the technique and equipment used. Sufficient volume of contrast medium should be administered to adequately fill the bladder. The usual volume ranges from 50 mL to 300 mL of OMNIPAQUE at a concentration of 100 mg Iodine/mL and 50 mL to 600 mL of OMNIPAQUE at a concentration of 50 mg Iodine/mL.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE may be diluted with Sterile Water for Injection as indicated in the table below:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTo Achieve\\r\\nAdd To\\r\\n \\r\\nA Final Concentration\\r\\nEach 100 mL of OMNIPAQUE Sterile Water for Injection, USP (mL)\\r\\n \\r\\n(mg Iodine/mL)\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n100\\r\\n200\\r\\n250\\r\\n \\r\\n90\\r\\n233\\r\\n289\\r\\n \\r\\n80\\r\\n275\\r\\n338\\r\\n \\r\\n70\\r\\n330\\r\\n400\\r\\n \\r\\n60\\r\\n400\\r\\n483\\r\\n \\r\\n50\\r\\n500\\r\\n600\\r\\nDilutions of OMNIPAQUE should be prepared just prior to use and any unused portion discarded after the procedure.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the knee joint in adults, and OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the shoulder joint in adults, and OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the temporomandibular joint in adults. Arthrography may be helpful in the diagnosis of posttraumatic or degenerative joint diseases, synovial rupture, the visualization of communicating bursae or cysts, and in meniscography.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nStrict aseptic technique is required to prevent infection. Fluoroscopic control should be used to ensure proper needle placement, prevent extracapsular injection, and prevent dilution of contrast medium. Undue pressure should not be exerted during injection.\\r\\nInjection of OMNIPAQUE into the joint is associated with transient discomfort, ie, pain, swelling. However, delayed, severe or persistent discomfort may occur occasionally. Severe pain may often result from undue use of pressure or the injection of large volumes. Joint swelling after injection is less with OMNIPAQUE than with high osmolar ionic contrast medium. These types of reactions are generally procedurally dependent and of greater frequency when double-contrast technique is employed.\\r\\n \\r\\nNervous system:\\r\\n \\r\\nSkin and appendages:\\r\\nArthrography is usually performed under local anesthesia. The amount of OMNIPAQUE injected is dependent on the size of the joint to be examined and the technique employed. Lower volumes of contrast medium are usually injected for knee and shoulder arthrography when double-contrast examinations using 15 mL to 100 mL of air are performed.\\r\\nThe following concentrations and volumes are recommended for normal adult knee, shoulder, and temporomandibular joints but should serve as guidelines since joints may require more or less contrast medium for optimal visualization.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nKNEE\\r\\n \\r\\nLower volumes recommended for double-contrast examinations; higher volumes recommended for single-contrast examinations.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSHOULDER\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR\\r\\nPassive or active manipulation is used to disperse the medium throughout the joint space.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the internal group of adult female reproductive organs; ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. Hysterosalpingography is utilized as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality in the treatment of infertility and other abnormal gynecological conditions.\\r\\nThe procedure should not be performed during the menstrual period or when menstrual flow is imminent, nor should it be performed when infection is present in any portion of the genital tract, including the external genitalia. The procedure is also contraindicated for pregnant women or for those in whom pregnancy is suspected. Its use is not advised for 6 months after termination of pregnancy or 30 days after conization or curettage.\\r\\nIn patients with carcinoma or in those in whom the condition is suspected, caution should be exercised to avoid possible spreading of the lesion by the procedure.\\r\\nInjection of OMNIPAQUE in hysterosalpingography is associated with immediate but transient pain. The cause of the pain may be due as much to the procedure itself as to the contrast medium injected, therefore attention should be paid to the injection pressure and volume instilled to avoid disruptive distention of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluoroscopic monitoring is recommended.\\r\\n \\r\\nNervous system:\\r\\n \\r\\nGastrointestinal system:\\r\\nThe recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 15 mL to 20 mL but will vary depending on individual anatomy and/or disease state.   \n",
       "1  OMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated for intrathecal administration in adults including myelography (lumbar, thoracic, cervical, total columnar) and in contrast enhancement for computerized tomography (myelography, cisternography, ventriculography).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 is indicated in adults for angiocardiography (ventriculography, selective coronary arteriography), aortography including studies of the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending aorta, abdominal aorta and its branches, intravenous digital subtraction angiography of the head, neck, abdominal, renal and peripheral vessels, peripheral arteriography, and excretory urography.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 is indicated in pediatric patients for angiocardiography (ventriculography, pulmonary arteriography, and venography; studies of the collateral arteries and aortography, including the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending and descending aorta). OMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in adults for aortography including studies of the aortic arch, abdominal aorta and its branches, cerebral arteriography, peripheral venography (phlebography), and excretory urography.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in pediatric patients for angiocardiography (ventriculography), excretory urography.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for angiocardiography (ventriculography, aortic root injections, and selective coronary arteriography). OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for angiocardiography (ventriculography, pulmonary arteriography, and venography, and studies of the collateral arteries).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients pediatric patients for angiocardiography (ventriculography).\\r\\nAfter both ventricular and coronary injection, decreases in systolic pressure were less pronounced and returned to baseline values earlier with OMNIPAQUE 350 than with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 produced less Q-T interval prolongation than seen with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.\\r\\nIn pediatric patients, after injection of all sites, but particularly following ventricular and pulmonary artery injections, decreases in both systolic and diastolic intravascular pressure were significantly less pronounced with OMNIPAQUE 350 than with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection. In pediatric patients OMNIPAQUE 350 produced significantly less shortening of the R-R interval than seen with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.\\r\\nIf repeat injections are made in rapid succession, all these changes are likely to be more pronounced. (See \\r\\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\r\\nDuring administration of large doses of OMNIPAQUE 350, continuous monitoring of vital signs is desirable. Caution is advised in the administration of large volumes to patients with incipient heart failure because of the possibility of aggravating the preexisting condition. Hypotension should be corrected promptly since it may induce serious arrhythmias. Special care regarding dosage should be observed in patients with right ventricular failure, pulmonary hypertension, or stenotic pulmonary vascular beds because of the hemodynamic changes which may occur after injection into the right heart outflow tract. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nPediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.\\r\\nCardiovascular system reactions in angiocardiography included angina (8%), hypotension (2.5%), bradycardia (1%), and tachycardia (1%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe individual dose or volume is determined by the size of the structure to be visualized, the anticipated degree of hemodilution, and valvular competence. Weight is a minor consideration in adults, but must be considered in infants and young pediatric patients. The volume of each individual injection is a more important consideration than the total dosage used. When large individual volumes are administered, as in ventriculography and aortography, it has been suggested that several minutes be permitted to elapse between each injection to allow for subsidence of possible hemodynamic disturbances.\\r\\nThe recommended single injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for angiocardiographic procedures in adults and the recommended single injection volumes of OMNIPAQUE 350 and OMNIPAQUE 300 for angiographic procedures in pediatric patients are as follows:\\r\\nThe usual adult volume for a single injection is 40 mL with a range of 30 mL to 60 mL. This may be repeated as necessary. When combined with selective coronary arteriography, the total administered volume should not exceed 250 mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose of OMNIPAQUE 350 is 1.25 mL/kg of body weight with a range of 1 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. For OMNIPAQUE 300 the usual single injection dose is 1.75 mL/kg with a range of 1.5 mL/kg to 2.0 mL/kg. When multiple injections are given, the total administered dose should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.\\r\\nThe usual adult volume for right or left coronary arteriography is 5 mL (range 3 mL to 14 mL) per injection.\\r\\nThe usual adult single injection volume is 50 mL, with a range of 20 mL to 75 mL.\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose is 1 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350.\\r\\nThe visualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.\\r\\nLarge doses of OMNIPAQUE 350 were well tolerated in angiographic procedures requiring multiple injections.\\r\\nThe maximum total volume for multiple procedures should not exceed 250 mL of 350 mg Iodine/mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nVisualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.\\r\\nThe maximum total dose for multiple injection procedures should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or 6 mL/kg up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL and OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL are indicated in adults for use in aortography and selective visceral arteriography including studies of the aortic arch, ascending aorta, and abdominal aorta and its branches (celiac, mesenteric, renal, hepatic and splenic arteries).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for use in aortography including studies of the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending and descending aorta.\\r\\nUnder conditions of slowed aortic circulation there is an increased likelihood for aortography to cause muscle spasm. Occasional serious neurologic complications, including paraplegia, have also been reported in patients with aortoiliac obstruction, femoral artery obstruction, abdominal compression, hypotension, hypertension, spinal anesthesia, and injection of vasopressors to increase contrast. In these patients the concentration, volume and number of repeat injections of the medium should be maintained at a minimum with appropriate intervals between injections. The position of the patient and catheter tip should be carefully monitored.\\r\\nEntry of a large aortic dose into the renal artery may cause, even in the absence of symptoms, albuminuria, hematuria, and an elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen. Rapid and complete return of function usually follows. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS ANGIOCARDIOGRAPHY\\r\\nThe usual adult volume as a single injection is 50 mL to 80 mL for the aorta, 30 mL to 60 mL for major branches including celiac and mesenteric arteries, and 5 mL to 15 mL for renal arteries. Repeated injections may be performed if indicated, but the total volume should not exceed 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300 or 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nThe usual single injection dose is 1.0 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350 and should not exceed 5.0 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in cerebral arteriography.\\r\\nThe degree of pain and flushing as the result of the use of OMNIPAQUE 300 in cerebral arteriography is less than that seen with comparable injections of many contrast media.\\r\\nIn cerebral arteriography, patients should be appropriately prepared consistent with existing or suspected disease states.\\r\\nCerebral arteriography should be undertaken with extreme care with special caution in elderly patients, patients in poor clinical condition, advanced arteriosclerosis, severe arterial hypertension, recent cerebral embolism or thrombosis, and cardiac decompensation.\\r\\nSince the contrast medium is given by rapid injection, the patient should be monitored for possible untoward reactions. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nCerebral arteriography with water-soluble contrast media has been associated with temporary neurologic complications including seizures, drowsiness, transient paresis, and mild disturbances in vision such as photomas of 1-second or less duration.\\r\\nCentral nervous system reactions in cerebral arteriography included photomas (15%), headache (5.5%), and pain (4.5%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is recommended for cerebral arteriography at the following volumes: common carotid artery (6 mL to 12 mL), internal carotid artery (8 mL to 10 mL), external carotid artery (6 mL to 9 mL), and vertebral artery (6 mL to 10 mL).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in intravenous digital subtraction angiography (I.V.DSA) of the vessels of the head, neck, and abdominal, renal and peripheral vessels.\\r\\nArteriograms of diagnostic quality can be obtained following the intravenous administration of contrast media employing digital subtraction and computer imaging enhancement techniques. The intravenous route of administration using these techniques has the advantage of being less invasive than the corresponding selective catheter placement of medium. The dose is administered into a peripheral vein, the superior vena cava or right atrium, usually by mechanical injection although sometimes by rapid manual injection. The technique has been used to visualize the ventricles, aorta and most of its larger branches, including the carotids, cerebrals, vertebrals, renal, celiac, mesenterics, and the major peripheral vessels of the limbs. Radiographic visualization of these structures is possible until significant hemodilution occurs.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 can be injected intravenously as a rapid bolus to provide arterial visualization using digital subtraction radiography. Preprocedural medications are not considered necessary. OMNIPAQUE 350 has provided diagnostic arterial radiographs in about 95% of patients. In some cases, poor arterial visualization has been attributed to patient movement. OMNIPAQUE 350 is very well tolerated in the vascular system. Patient discomfort (general sensation of heat and/or pain) following injection is less than with various other contrast media.\\r\\nSince the contrast medium is usually administered mechanically under high pressure, rupture of smaller peripheral veins can occur. It has been suggested that this can be avoided by using an intravenous catheter threaded proximally beyond larger tributaries or, in the case of the antecubital vein, into the superior vena cava. Sometimes the femoral vein is used. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nCardiovascular system reactions in digital arteriography included transient PVCs (16%) and PACs (6.5%). (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe usual injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for the intravenous digital technique is 30 mL to 50 mL of a 350 mg Iodine/mL solution. This is administered as a bolus at 7.5 to 30 mL/second using a pressure injector. The volume and rate of injection will depend primarily on the type of equipment and technique used.\\r\\nFrequently three or more injections may be required, up to a total volume not to exceed 250 mL (87.5 g Iodine).\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral arteriography. OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral venography.\\r\\nSedative medication may be employed prior to use. Anesthesia is not considered necessary. Patient discomfort during and immediately following injection is substantially less than that following injection of various other contrast media. Moderate to severe discomfort is very unusual.\\r\\nPulsation should be present in the artery to be injected. In thromboangiitis obliterans, or ascending infection associated with severe ischemia, angiography should be performed with extreme caution, if at all. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nA transient sensation of mild warmth is usual, immediately following injection. This has not interfered with the procedure.\\r\\nIn phlebography the incidence of leg pain was 21%. This usually was mild and lasted a short time after injection. (See \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nThe volume required will depend on the size, flow rate, and disease state of the injected vessel and on the size and condition of the patient, as well as the imaging technique used.

(See \\r\\nSection III\\r\\nFor pharmacokinetics of excretion in adults, see \\r\\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY--Intravascular\\r\\nPreparatory dehydration is not recommended in the elderly, pediatric patients, diabetic or azotemic patients, or in patients with suspected myelomatosis.\\r\\nPediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.\\r\\nSince there is a possibility of temporary suppression of urine formation, it is recommended that a suitable interval elapse before excretory urography is repeated, especially in patients with unilateral or bilateral reduction in renal function. (See \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nSee \\r\\nADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular--General\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 at dosages from 200 mg Iodine/kg body weight to 350 mg Iodine/kg body weight have produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory system in patients with normal renal function.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at doses of 0.5 mL/kg to 3 mL/kg of body weight has produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory tract. The usual dose for pediatric patients is 1 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. Dosage for pediatric patients should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 have osmolalities from approximately 2.4 to 3 times that of plasma (285 mOsm/kg water) and are hypertonic under conditions of use.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 350 is indicated in adults for arthrography and oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 is indicated in adults for arthrography and hysterosalpingography.

OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 9 mg Iodine/mL to 21 mg Iodine/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL administered intravenously are indicated in pediatric patients for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nOral administration of OMNIPAQUE is most often associated with mild, transient diarrhea especially when high concentrations and large volumes are administered. Nausea, vomiting, and moderate diarrhea have also been reported following orally administered OMNIPAQUE, but much less frequently. For CT examinations using dilute oral plus intravenous contrast medium, adverse events are more likely to be associated with the intravenous injection than the hypotonic oral solution. It should be noted that serious or anaphylactoid reactions that may occur with intravascular iodinated media are possible following administration by other routes.\\r\\nIn controlled clinical trials involving 54 adult patients for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 350, the following adverse reactions were reported:\\r\\ndiarrhea (42%), nausea (15%), vomiting (11%), abdominal pain (7%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%). In controlled clinical studies involving 44 adult patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (2%). \\r\\nIn controlled clinical studies involving 58 pediatric patients for examination of the gastrointestinal tract at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL, the following adverse reactions were reported: diarrhea (36%), vomiting (9%), nausea (5%), fever (5%), hypotension (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and urticaria (2%). In clinical studies an increased frequency and severity of diarrhea was noted with an increase in the administered concentration and dose of the radiocontrast agent. In controlled clinical studies involving 69 pediatric patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (1.4%).\\r\\nThe recommended dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mg Iodine/mL for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract in adults is 50 mL to 100 mL depending on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. The recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 6 mg Iodine/mL to 9 mg Iodine/mL for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen in adults is 500 mL to 1000 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). In conjunction with dilute oral administration, the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 intravenously is 100 mL to 150 mL. The oral dose is administered about 20 to 40 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.\\r\\nThe dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL, is dependent on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. Based on clinical experience, it is recommended that OMNIPAQUE 180 (available in single use vials), be used in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age.

Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). The total oral dose in grams of iodine should generally not exceed 5 g Iodine for pediatric patients under 3 years of age and 10 g Iodine for pediatric patients from 3 to 18 years of age. The oral dosage may be given all at once or over a period of 30 to 45 minutes if there is difficulty in consuming the required volume. In conjunction with dilute oral administration the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 2mL/kg when administered intravenously with a range of 1 mL/kg to 2 mL/kg. Dosage pediatric patients should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total intravenously administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg. The oral dose is administered about 30 to 60 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE may be diluted with water or beverage as follows:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTo Achieve\\r\\nAdd\\r\\nTo\\r\\n \\r\\nOne Liter of Contrast Medium at A Final Concentration\\r\\nStock Concentration of OMNIPAQUE\\r\\nVolume\\r\\nWater, Carbonated Beverage, Milk, or Juice\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n6\\r\\n300\\r\\n20\\r\\n980\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n17\\r\\n983\\r\\n \\r\\n9\\r\\n300\\r\\n30\\r\\n970\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n26\\r\\n974\\r\\n \\r\\n12\\r\\n300\\r\\n40\\r\\n960\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n35\\r\\n965\\r\\n \\r\\n15\\r\\n300\\r\\n50\\r\\n950\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n43\\r\\n957\\r\\n \\r\\n18\\r\\n300\\r\\n60\\r\\n940\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n52\\r\\n948\\r\\n \\r\\n21\\r\\n300\\r\\n70\\r\\n930\\r\\n \\r\\n350\\r\\n60\\r\\n940\\r\\nDilutions of OMNIPAQUE should be prepared just prior to use and any unused portion discarded after the procedure.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 50 mg Iodine/mL to 100 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in pediatric patients for voiding cystourethrography.

The concentration may vary depending upon the patient's size and age and also with the technique and equipment used. Sufficient volume of contrast medium should be administered to adequately fill the bladder.

Arthrography may be helpful in the diagnosis of posttraumatic or degenerative joint diseases, synovial rupture, the visualization of communicating bursae or cysts, and in meniscography.\\r\\nSee \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS--General\\r\\nStrict aseptic technique is required to prevent infection. Fluoroscopic control should be used to ensure proper needle placement, prevent extracapsular injection, and prevent dilution of contrast medium. Undue pressure should not be exerted during injection.\\r\\nInjection of OMNIPAQUE into the joint is associated with transient discomfort, ie, pain, swelling. However, delayed, severe or persistent discomfort may occur occasionally. Severe pain may often result from undue use of pressure or the injection of large volumes. Joint swelling after injection is less with OMNIPAQUE than with high osmolar ionic contrast medium. These types of reactions are generally procedurally dependent and of greater frequency when double-contrast technique is employed.\\r\\n \\r\\nNervous system:\\r\\n \\r\\nSkin and appendages:\\r\\nArthrography is usually performed under local anesthesia. The amount of OMNIPAQUE injected is dependent on the size of the joint to be examined and the technique employed. Lower volumes of contrast medium are usually injected for knee and shoulder arthrography when double-contrast examinations using 15 mL to 100 mL of air are performed.\\r\\nThe following concentrations and volumes are recommended for normal adult knee, shoulder, and temporomandibular joints but should serve as guidelines since joints may require more or less contrast medium for optimal visualization.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nKNEE\\r\\n \\r\\nLower volumes recommended for double-contrast examinations; higher volumes recommended for single-contrast examinations.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSHOULDER\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR\\r\\nPassive or active manipulation is used to disperse the medium throughout the joint space.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mg Iodine/mL is indicated in radiography of the internal group of adult female reproductive organs; ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. Hysterosalpingography is utilized as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality in the treatment of infertility and other abnormal gynecological conditions.\\r\\nThe procedure should not be performed during the menstrual period or when menstrual flow is imminent, nor should it be performed when infection is present in any portion of the genital tract, including the external genitalia. The procedure is also contraindicated for pregnant women or for those in whom pregnancy is suspected. Its use is not advised for 6 months after termination of pregnancy or 30 days after conization or curettage.\\r\\nIn patients with carcinoma or in those in whom the condition is suspected, caution should be exercised to avoid possible spreading of the lesion by the procedure.\\r\\nInjection of OMNIPAQUE in hysterosalpingography is associated with immediate but transient pain. The cause of the pain may be due as much to the procedure itself as to the contrast medium injected, therefore attention should be paid to the injection pressure and volume instilled to avoid disruptive distention of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluoroscopic monitoring is recommended.\\r\\n \\r\\nNervous system:\\r\\n \\r\\nGastrointestinal system:\\r\\nThe recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 15 mL to 20 mL but will vary depending on individual anatomy and/or disease state.   \n",

Myelography should not be performed in the presence of significant local or systemic infection where bacteremia is likely. Intrathecal administration of corticosteroids with OMNIPAQUE is contraindicated. Because of the possibility of overdosage, immediate repeat myelography in the event of technical failure is contraindicated (see \\r\\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to iohexol.\\r\\nOMNIPAQUE should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to iohexol.\\r\\nThe procedure should not be performed during the menstrual period or when menstrual flow is imminent, nor should it be performed when infection is present in any portion of the genital tract, including the external genitalia.
