 Information for Patients
 
  
 Pregnancy Category X
 Ribavirin capsules are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to ribavirin or any component of the capsule.
 Patients with autoimmune hepatitis must not be treated with combination ribavirin/INTRON A therapy because using these medicines can make the hepatitis worse.
 Patients with hemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia major, sickle-cell anemia) should not be treated with ribavirin capsules.
 Combination ribavirin capsules/INTRON A therapy must not be used by females who are pregnant or by males whose female partners are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients taking combination ribavirin capsules/INTRON A therapy. Combination ribavirin capsules/INTRON A therapy should not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy. Females of childbearing potential and males must use two forms of effective contraception during treatment and during the 6 months after treatment has been concluded. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated for ribavirin in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. These effects occurred at doses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose of ribavirin capsules. If pregnancy occurs in a patient or partner of a patient during treatment or during the 6 months after treatment stops, physicians are encouraged to report such cases by calling the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry at 1-800-593-2214.
