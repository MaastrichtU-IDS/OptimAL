       "      <td>CUPRIMINE is indicated in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and in patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Available evidence suggests that CUPRIMINE is not of value in ankylosing spondylitis. \\r\\nWilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) occurs in individuals who have inherited an autosomal-recessive defect that leads to an accumulation of copper far in excess of metabolic requirements. The excess copper is deposited in several organs and tissues, and eventually produces pathological effects primarily in the liver, where damage progresses to postnecrotic cirrhosis, and in the brain, where degeneration is widespread. Copper is also deposited as characteristic, asymptomatic, golden-brown Kayser-Fleischer rings in the corneas of all patients with cerebral symptomatology and some patients who are either asymptomatic or manifest only hepatic symptomatology. \\r\\nTwo types of patients require treatment for Wilson's disease: (1) the symptomatic, and (2) the asymptomatic in whom it can be assumed the disease will develop in the future if the patient is not treated. \\r\\nThe diagnosis, if suspected on the basis of family or individual history or physical examination, can be confirmed if the plasma copper-protein ceruloplasmin** is less than 20 mg/dL and either a quantitative determination in a liver biopsy specimen shows an abnormally high concentration of copper (greater than 250 mcg/g dry weight) or Kayser-Fleischer rings are present. \\r\\nTreatment has two objectives: \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n(1)\\r\\n \\r\\n(2)\\r\\nThe first objective is attained by a daily diet that contains no more than 1 or 2 mg of copper. Such a diet should exclude, most importantly, chocolate, nuts, shellfish, mushrooms, liver, molasses, broccoli, and cereals and dietary supplements enriched with copper, and be composed to as great an extent as possible of foods with a low copper content. Distilled or demineralized water should be used if the patient's drinking water contains more than 0.1 mg/L of copper. \\r\\nFor the second objective, a copper chelating agent is used. \\r\\nIn symptomatic patients, this treatment usually produces marked neurologic improvement, fading of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and gradual amelioration of hepatic dysfunction and psychic disturbances. \\r\\nClinical experience to date suggests that life is prolonged with the above regimen. \\r\\nNoticeable improvement may not occur for 1 to 3 months. Occasionally, neurologic symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE. Despite this, the drug should not be withdrawn. Temporary interruption carries an increased risk of developing a sensitivity reaction upon resumption of therapy, although it may result in clinical improvement of neurological symptoms (see \\r\\nWARNINGS\\r\\nTreatment of asymptomatic patients has been carried out for over 30 years. Symptoms and signs of the disease appear to be prevented indefinitely if daily treatment with CUPRIMINE is continued. \\r\\nCystinuria is characterized by excessive urinary excretion of the dibasic amino acids, arginine, lysine, ornithine, and cystine, and the mixed disulfide of cysteine and homocysteine. The metabolic defect that leads to cystinuria is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. Metabolism of the affected amino acids is influenced by at least two abnormal factors: (1) defective gastrointestinal absorption and (2) renal tubular dysfunction. \\r\\nArginine, lysine, ornithine, and cysteine are soluble substances, readily excreted. There is no apparent pathology connected with their excretion in excessive quantities. \\r\\nCystine, however, is so slightly soluble at the usual range of urinary pH that it is not excreted readily, and so crystallizes and forms stones in the urinary tract. Stone formation is the only known pathology in cystinuria. \\r\\nNormal daily output of cystine is 40 to 80 mg. In cystinuria, output is greatly increased and may exceed 1 g/day. At 500 to 600 mg/day, stone formation is almost certain. When it is more than 300 mg/day, treatment is indicated.\\r\\nConventional treatment is directed at keeping urinary cystine diluted enough to prevent stone formation, keeping the urine alkaline enough to dissolve as much cystine as possible, and minimizing cystine production by a diet low in methionine (the major dietary precursor of cystine). Patients must drink enough fluid to keep urine-specific gravity below 1.010, take enough alkali to keep urinary pH at 7.5 to 8, and maintain a diet low in methionine. This diet is not recommended in growing children and probably is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its low protein content (see \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS\\r\\nWhen these measures are inadequate to control recurrent stone formation, CUPRIMINE may be used as additional therapy, and when patients refuse to adhere to conventional treatment, CUPRIMINE may be a useful substitute. It is capable of keeping cystine excretion to near normal values, thereby hindering stone formation and the serious consequences of pyelonephritis and impaired renal function that develop in some patients. Bartter and colleagues depict the process by which penicillamine interacts with cystine to form penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide as:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC + PS'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCS' + CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPSSP + CS'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPS' + CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC + PSSP'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n2CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC = cystine\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCS' = deprotonated cysteine\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPSSP = penicillamine disulfide\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPS' = deprotonated penicillamine sulfhydryl\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSP = penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide\\r\\nIn this process, it is assumed that the deprotonated form of penicillamine, PS', is the active factor in bringing about the disulfide interchange. \\r\\nBecause CUPRIMINE can cause severe adverse reactions, its use in rheumatoid arthritis should be restricted to patients who have severe, active disease and who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Even then, benefit-to-risk ratio should be carefully considered. Other measures, such as rest, physiotherapy, salicylates, and corticosteroids, should be used, when indicated, in conjunction with CUPRIMINE (see \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS</td>\n",

Therapy may be instituted before results of susceptibility studies are known; however, once these results become available, the antibiotic treatment should be adjusted accordingly.\\r\\nIn certain cases of confirmed or suspected gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis or in patients with other serious infections in which the causative organism has not been identified, cefotaxime for injection USP may be used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside. The dosage recommended in the labeling of both antibiotics may be given and depends on the severity of the infection and the patient's condition. Renal function should be carefully monitored, especially if higher dosages of the aminoglycosides are to be administered or if therapy is prolonged, because of the potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. It is possible that nephrotoxicity may be potentiated if cefotaxime for injection USP is used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside. \\r\\nThe administration of cefotaxime for injection USP preoperatively reduces the incidence of certain infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures (e.g., abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract surgery) that may be classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated. \\r\\nIn patients undergoing cesarean section, intraoperative (after clamping the umbilical cord) and postoperative use of cefotaxime for injection USP may also reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections. See \\r\\n \\r\\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \\r\\nEffective use for elective surgery depends on the time of administration. To achieve effective tissue levels, cefotaxime for injection USP should be given 1/2 or 1 1/2 hours before surgery. See \\r\\n \\r\\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \\r\\nFor patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery, preoperative bowel preparation by mechanical cleansing as well as with a non-absorbable antibiotic (e.g., neomycin) is recommended. \\r\\nIf there are signs of infection, specimens for culture should be obtained for identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted. \\r\\nTo reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefotaxime for injection USP and other antibacterial drugs, cefotaxime for injection USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</td>\n",

       "0  CUPRIMINE is indicated in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and in patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Available evidence suggests that CUPRIMINE is not of value in ankylosing spondylitis. \\r\\nWilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) occurs in individuals who have inherited an autosomal-recessive defect that leads to an accumulation of copper far in excess of metabolic requirements. The excess copper is deposited in several organs and tissues, and eventually produces pathological effects primarily in the liver, where damage progresses to postnecrotic cirrhosis, and in the brain, where degeneration is widespread. Copper is also deposited as characteristic, asymptomatic, golden-brown Kayser-Fleischer rings in the corneas of all patients with cerebral symptomatology and some patients who are either asymptomatic or manifest only hepatic symptomatology. \\r\\nTwo types of patients require treatment for Wilson's disease: (1) the symptomatic, and (2) the asymptomatic in whom it can be assumed the disease will develop in the future if the patient is not treated. \\r\\nThe diagnosis, if suspected on the basis of family or individual history or physical examination, can be confirmed if the plasma copper-protein ceruloplasmin** is less than 20 mg/dL and either a quantitative determination in a liver biopsy specimen shows an abnormally high concentration of copper (greater than 250 mcg/g dry weight) or Kayser-Fleischer rings are present. \\r\\nTreatment has two objectives: \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n(1)\\r\\n \\r\\n(2)\\r\\nThe first objective is attained by a daily diet that contains no more than 1 or 2 mg of copper. Such a diet should exclude, most importantly, chocolate, nuts, shellfish, mushrooms, liver, molasses, broccoli, and cereals and dietary supplements enriched with copper, and be composed to as great an extent as possible of foods with a low copper content. Distilled or demineralized water should be used if the patient's drinking water contains more than 0.1 mg/L of copper. \\r\\nFor the second objective, a copper chelating agent is used. \\r\\nIn symptomatic patients, this treatment usually produces marked neurologic improvement, fading of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and gradual amelioration of hepatic dysfunction and psychic disturbances. \\r\\nClinical experience to date suggests that life is prolonged with the above regimen. \\r\\nNoticeable improvement may not occur for 1 to 3 months. Occasionally, neurologic symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE. Despite this, the drug should not be withdrawn. Temporary interruption carries an increased risk of developing a sensitivity reaction upon resumption of therapy, although it may result in clinical improvement of neurological symptoms (see \\r\\nWARNINGS\\r\\nTreatment of asymptomatic patients has been carried out for over 30 years. Symptoms and signs of the disease appear to be prevented indefinitely if daily treatment with CUPRIMINE is continued. \\r\\nCystinuria is characterized by excessive urinary excretion of the dibasic amino acids, arginine, lysine, ornithine, and cystine, and the mixed disulfide of cysteine and homocysteine. The metabolic defect that leads to cystinuria is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. Metabolism of the affected amino acids is influenced by at least two abnormal factors: (1) defective gastrointestinal absorption and (2) renal tubular dysfunction. \\r\\nArginine, lysine, ornithine, and cysteine are soluble substances, readily excreted. There is no apparent pathology connected with their excretion in excessive quantities. \\r\\nCystine, however, is so slightly soluble at the usual range of urinary pH that it is not excreted readily, and so crystallizes and forms stones in the urinary tract. Stone formation is the only known pathology in cystinuria. \\r\\nNormal daily output of cystine is 40 to 80 mg. In cystinuria, output is greatly increased and may exceed 1 g/day. At 500 to 600 mg/day, stone formation is almost certain. When it is more than 300 mg/day, treatment is indicated.\\r\\nConventional treatment is directed at keeping urinary cystine diluted enough to prevent stone formation, keeping the urine alkaline enough to dissolve as much cystine as possible, and minimizing cystine production by a diet low in methionine (the major dietary precursor of cystine). Patients must drink enough fluid to keep urine-specific gravity below 1.010, take enough alkali to keep urinary pH at 7.5 to 8, and maintain a diet low in methionine. This diet is not recommended in growing children and probably is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its low protein content (see \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS\\r\\nWhen these measures are inadequate to control recurrent stone formation, CUPRIMINE may be used as additional therapy, and when patients refuse to adhere to conventional treatment, CUPRIMINE may be a useful substitute. It is capable of keeping cystine excretion to near normal values, thereby hindering stone formation and the serious consequences of pyelonephritis and impaired renal function that develop in some patients. Bartter and colleagues depict the process by which penicillamine interacts with cystine to form penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide as:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC + PS'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCS' + CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPSSP + CS'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPS' + CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC + PSSP'\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n2CSSP\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSC = cystine\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCS' = deprotonated cysteine\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPSSP = penicillamine disulfide\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPS' = deprotonated penicillamine sulfhydryl\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCSSP = penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide\\r\\nIn this process, it is assumed that the deprotonated form of penicillamine, PS', is the active factor in bringing about the disulfide interchange. \\r\\nBecause CUPRIMINE can cause severe adverse reactions, its use in rheumatoid arthritis should be restricted to patients who have severe, active disease and who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Even then, benefit-to-risk ratio should be carefully considered. Other measures, such as rest, physiotherapy, salicylates, and corticosteroids, should be used, when indicated, in conjunction with CUPRIMINE (see \\r\\nPRECAUTIONS   \n",

studies have not been reported in animals or humans, mothers on therapy with penicillamine should not nurse their infants. \\r\\nPatients with a history of penicillamine-related aplastic anemia or

Therapy may be instituted before results of susceptibility studies are known; however, once these results become available, the antibiotic treatment should be adjusted accordingly.\\r\\nIn certain cases of confirmed or suspected gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis or in patients with other serious infections in which the causative organism has not been identified, cefotaxime for injection USP may be used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside. The dosage recommended in the labeling of both antibiotics may be given and depends on the severity of the infection and the patient's condition. Renal function should be carefully monitored, especially if higher dosages of the aminoglycosides are to be administered or if therapy is prolonged, because of the potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. It is possible that nephrotoxicity may be potentiated if cefotaxime for injection USP is used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside. \\r\\nThe administration of cefotaxime for injection USP preoperatively reduces the incidence of certain infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures (e.g., abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract surgery) that may be classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated. \\r\\nIn patients undergoing cesarean section, intraoperative (after clamping the umbilical cord) and postoperative use of cefotaxime for injection USP may also reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections. See \\r\\n \\r\\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \\r\\nEffective use for elective surgery depends on the time of administration. To achieve effective tissue levels, cefotaxime for injection USP should be given 1/2 or 1 1/2 hours before surgery. See \\r\\n \\r\\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \\r\\nFor patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery, preoperative bowel preparation by mechanical cleansing as well as with a non-absorbable antibiotic (e.g., neomycin) is recommended. \\r\\nIf there are signs of infection, specimens for culture should be obtained for identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted. \\r\\nTo reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefotaxime for injection USP and other antibacterial drugs, cefotaxime for injection USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
